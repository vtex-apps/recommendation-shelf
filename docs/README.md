The Product Recommendation app shows a selection of products using [recommendation strategies](#recommendation-shelf-props). For example, you can use the Product Recommendation to suggest often bought-together products to the one that the user is looking for.
 
![recommendation-shelf-buy-together](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52087100/96002543-9c07fe80-0e0f-11eb-94c3-cac778eaf21c.png)
 
## Prerequisites
 
>‚ÑπÔ∏è The Product Recommendation app does not fetch user data for itself. However, most recommendation strategies require user navigation data to provide relevant suggestions to users. Hence, before proceeding any further, make sure you have an app capable of tracking user navigation installed on your VTEX account.
 
Make sure you have the Biggy pixel app installed on your VTEX account or install it by the following steps:
 
1. Open a [Support ticket](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests) about your interest in installing the Recommendations Shelf and Biggy Pixel apps. You should expect an App Key as a response. Save it for the 6th step of this tutorial.
2. Using your terminal, install the `biggy.pixel` app by running the following command:
 
```
vtex install biggy.pixel
```
 
3. Access your VTEX account by the Admin.
4. Using the Admin's sidebar, access the **Apps** section and select the **Biggy Pixel** app.
5. Click on **Settings**.
6. In the `apiKey` field, enter the App Key provided by the VTEX team.
7. Save your changes.
 
## Configuration
 
1. Using your terminal, install the `recommendation-resolver` app on your account. This app will solve the recommendation queries of your store shelves.
 
```
vtex install vtex.recommendation-resolver
```
 
2. Add the `recommendation-shelf` app to your theme's dependencies on the `manifest.json`:
 
 
```diff
  "dependencies": {
+   "vtex.recommendation-shelf": "1.x"
  }
````
 
Now, you can use all blocks exported by the `recommendation-shelf` app. Check out the complete list below:
\
&nbsp;


| Block name     | Description                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `recommendation-shelf` | Displays a list of recommended products on any store page.   |
| `recommendation-buy-together` | Displays a list of recommended products to buy together on the product details page. |
| `recommendation-refresh` | Displays a list of recommended products based on the user history on your store pages. |

`recommendation-refresh`

![recommendation-refresh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtex-apps/recommendation-shelf/master/docs/Screenshot_3.png)

 
3. Add the `recommendation-shelf` app to your store template. See the example below to know how to add it to a template:
 
```json
  "store.home": {
    "blocks": [
      "flex-layout.row#recommendation-shelf",
    ]
  },
  "flex-layout.row#recommendation-shelf": {
    "children": ["recommendation-shelf"]
  }
```
 
>‚ÑπÔ∏è You can add the `recommendation-shelf` in any store template desired, such as the `store.home` or `store.product`. You can also add the `recommendation-buy-together` and `recommendation-refresh` blocks if desired. For example:
 
```json
  "store.product": {
    "blocks": [
      "flex-layout.row#buy-together",
    ]
  },
  "flex-layout.row#buy-together": {
    "children": ["recommendation-buy-together"]
  }
```
 
```json
  "store.home": {
    "blocks": [
      "flex-layout.row#recommendation-refresh",
    ]
  },
  "flex-layout.row#recommendation-refresh": {
    "children": ["recommendation-refresh"]
  }
```
 
## Setting up the `recommendation-shelf`
 
To configure the `recommendation-shelf` you will need to add props to it. Check the following tables to know what props that the app includes and how to configure them. 
 
### `recommendation-shelf` props
\
&nbsp;

## Advanced configuration
 
You can customize the blocks `recommendation-shelf`, `recommendation-refresh`, and `recommendation-buy-together`by adding the `shelf-components` app to your theme's dependencies on the `manifest.json` file:
 
```diff
  "dependencies": {
+   "vtex.shelf-components": "0.x"
  }
````
 
Now it is possible to customize these blocks, building their components by using its children blocks `default-shelf`, `refresh-shelf`, and `buy-together`, respectively.
 
Below, you can find an implementation example for each one of them. If needed, use these blocks in your store theme code and make the desired changes according to your needs:
 
```json
  "store.home": {
    "blocks": [
      "flex-layout.row#recommendation-shelf",
    ]
